# SudokuSolver
A program to solve any given Sudoku board.

Testing is done using Unittest. Some sample boards have been used. 

Boards are given in the following format:

A single String containing all values of the board. A number for the value and a "." (period) to represent a blank square.
Example: ".3.....8...9...5....75.92..7..1.5..8.2..9..3.9..4.2..1..42.71....2...8...7.....9."

This is read left to right, where the first 9 values represent the first row, the next 9 represent the next row and so on. 

Testing can be done by running the command: python3 tests.py or python3 tests.py -v if you want to a more verbose output.
